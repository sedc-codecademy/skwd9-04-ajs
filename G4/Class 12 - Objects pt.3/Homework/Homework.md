## Refactor

Previous homework about inheritance refactor it (in a separate homework) with classes.

In addition:
* make get/set for liveInSaltWater in AquaticAnimal, typeOfFur in TerrestrialAnimal and typeOfFood in WildAnimal
* add new properties in DomesticAnimal...The first one is hasOwner boolean value and price. In addtition add static ownerPrice method that in case any animal has owner should add addtional 1000 to it's price value

## Bonus

Redo the same homework separately only using Object.create()

# Homework

1. Change the calculator homework to work with arrow functions

2. Write a function that will reverse a string as output (any string), using recursion
e.g. Hello -> olleH

3. Write a function that will take two arguments. First argument should be a sentence, second one should be one word.
Return how many times the word had appeared in that sentence.
e.g appearance('This was a hot summer, and a very dry one', 'a') -> should return that 'a' was present 2 times.

4. Using recursive function do the function that will calculate Fibonacci sequence for any number.
fibonacciSequence(n) (where n is positve real number) and print the result.
e.g fibonacciSequence(8) -> should return array of following numbers 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21

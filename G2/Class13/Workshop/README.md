# Counrtipedia
## We want to create an app for searching through countries
 
Our app should use the [rest countries API](https://restcountries.eu/#api-endpoints-all). It should use
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/). This app should have the following functionalities:
* Search countries by name
* Search countries by currency
* Search countries whose main language is English
* Show the details for Macedonia
* The details for each country should be shown in a box, containing image, details and link to wikipedia.

### The page should be single page app (SPA).
